- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

### What I learned

While building this project I learned to use global states using 

```js 
createContext();
```
From now on I know a better way to deal with projects that demands the use of shared states.
